- 👋 Hi, I’m Ted Ndege.
- 👀 I’m interested in Backend Development, Linux, Cloud computing and Web Automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software design patterns, linux server adminstration and  ui design(for personal projects).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting challenging project preferrably on any automation or anything solving business problems especially in the agribusiness field. I did not specify a language as i've learned more and more i can switch one out for another given good software architecture but i prefer Java or Python.
- 📫 You can reach me at tedndg@gmail.com via email, linkedin or skype, dont hesitate.
